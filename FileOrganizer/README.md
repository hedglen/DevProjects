# File Organizer

A PowerShell script that automatically sorts your Downloads folder into subfolders by file extension.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Scans the Downloads directory
2. Groups files by their extension (e.g., `.exe`, `.ps1`, `.toml`)
3. Moves them into `/Downloads/Organized/[EXT]/`

## 🛠️ To Run

```powershell
pwsh ./organize.ps1
